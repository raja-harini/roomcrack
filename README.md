# SOLVING OF CTF CHALLENGE


### To find IP address of unknown machine:

```nmap 10.0.2.15/24 â€“open```

 ![alt text](nmap.jpg)

### Run nmap scan for identified IP after neglecting unwanted options:

```nmap -sV -p- -T4 -A 10.0.2.5/24 â€“open```
 
 ![alt text](<nmap v1.jpg>)

 ![alt text](<nmap v2.jpg>)

### From the above scan, we can find 3 ports are available open to crack the machine i.e, port 80,8080,65000 are open
#### Port 80:

### Analysing the page source, we got login credentials
 
![alt text](<80 pg.jpg>)

### Login the page
 
![alt text](<80 l.jpg>)

### Audio plays for successful login

#### Port 8080:
 
![alt text](8080.jpg)

### Analysing the page source, we got login credentials
 
![alt text](<8080 pg.jpg>)

### Login the page

![alt text](<8080 l.jpg>)
 
### Redirection is set to login page with timer of 15 seconds

#### Port 65000:
 
![alt text](65000.jpg)

### Analysing the page source, we got login credentials

 ![alt text](<65000 pg.jpg>)

### Login the page

![alt text](<65000 l.jpg>)
 
### Image gif appears 

#### When we analyse both the gifâ€™s source, we come to know about login credentials of the machine
#### This is done using â€˜ exiftool â€˜ and encryption techniques like Atbash cipher and Caesar cipher

Or 

### Hydra tool can be performed to crack the user

```hydra -L username100.txt -P password100.txt ssh://10.0.2.5```
 
 ![alt text](hydra.jpg)

### After finding the login credentials of the unknown machine, login the server using ssh

```ssh elliot@10.0.2.5```

![alt text](ssh.jpg)
 
### Find the flag from pagam3 file

### To switch user, first see hidden files

```ls -la```
 
 ![alt text](<ls -la.jpg>)

### Find the login credentials from hidden files as rajini@dec12
### Switch the user

```su rajini```

![alt text](su.jpg)
 
### Find the flag in pagam file



## Conclusion :
In this CTF challenge, we identified the target machine's IP using Nmap and conducted a thorough service enumeration. The scan revealed ports 80, 8080, and 65000 open, each leading to crucial login credentials through page source analysis.
By logging into each discovered portal, we encountered audio feedback, timed redirections, and hidden image files. Using ExifTool and decryption methods like Atbash and Caesar ciphers, we extracted additional credentials. Alternatively, brute-forcing with Hydra was an option.
With valid SSH credentials, we accessed the machine and explored hidden files, discovering another set of login details. Switching users with su, we ultimately retrieved the flag from the hidden pagam file, successfully completing the challenge. ðŸš©ðŸ”¥
